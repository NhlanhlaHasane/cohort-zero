## About me

I'm a programmer with a mathematics background living in Birmingham, UK. I've been interested in blockchains for a long time, but have only gotten seriously involved with them recently.

## My CDAP Project

During the CDAP I worked on the new [execution layer specifications](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs). My main contributions were:

* Designing the interface for interacting with the Ethereum state.
* Providing an optimized implementation for the Ethereum state that make the running the execution specs against Mainnet feasible in practice.
* Various bugfixes to enable the execution specs to sync all of the Frontier hardfork (upto block 1,150,000 which is the start of Homestead).

I didn't write any development updates during my CDAP participation.

## Job stuff

* I am not willing to relocate outside of Great Britain.
* I am interested in remote work.
* I intend to work on the Ethereum Execution Specs until they reach a point when they are usable as a definitive specification of the Ethereum Protocol.
