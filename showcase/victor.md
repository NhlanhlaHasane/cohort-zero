## About Me

I am someone who likes to create things. I try to view software engineering as
an art, and I am continually trying to get better at my craft. I try to take
a creative approach with most things I do.

Besides programming and learning about technology, I am also a guitarist,
water polo player, and movie script writer.

## My CDAP Project

My initial goals were to learn as much about the Ethereum protocol as I could.
Coming in with only a high-level understanding of how blockchains worked, my
goal was to learn as much as I could about all areas of the protocol, I did not
have a specific preference.

I started off by reading the yellow paper, learning about the EVM, and various
ETH data structures. Some of my notes are included in the link above.

At the time, I was teaching myself about computer networking, so I was leaning
towards the network layer of the protocol. This set me on a journey of reading
and writing about the devp2p protocol suite. I began a devp2p guidebook since
I saw a lack of educational material there.

My learning soon began to coincide with the portal network, and since this was
a new development, I decided to hop on. This required surpassing another
learning block, reading the various specs, and understanding the goal of the
portal network.

Ultimately, I ended up working on implementing content-keys SSZ encoding and
decoding functionality, as well as implementing the OFFER/ACCEPT messages for
for the Trin client. My work is not done and I plan to continue contributing to
the Trin client. Along the way, I picked up skills in Rust, and concurrent
programming.

## Job Stuff

I am interested in working anywhere in the blockchain space. I am open to
relocate and remote work, and also open to both part time and full time
positions.
