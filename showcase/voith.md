## About Me

I'm a software engineer interested in all things related to Ethereum. I have 7 
years of professional experience of which the past 3 years have been spent working
on DeFi projects. At my last job I lead a team of engineers to build software 
for payroll processing and accounting.

## My CDAP Project

The focus of my project was on writing an executable spec of Ethereum's Yellow 
paper. The aim was to build a readable implementation with lots of documentation
so that it becomes easy for new Ethereum explorers to understand the protocol.

For this we've built the [execution-specs] project. The project currently has a
functional implementation of the frontier hard fork and it's still work in 
progress.

Over the course of the program, I achieved the following:
- I can now make sense of the yellow paper(I couldn't when I started).
- I learnt to debug consensus issues related to transaction execution.
- I learnt some history of the protocol while digging consensus issues.

## Development Updates

You can read more about the work I did during the program in my development
updates:

- [Update 1]: Implemented header verification in the execution-specs repo.
- [Update 2]: Implemented memory operation opcodes in the execution-specs repo.
- [Update 3]: Implemented contract creation, CREATE and RETURN opcodes in the execution-specs repo.
- [Update 4]: Implemented opcodes CALL, CALLCODE and SELFDESTRUCT in the execution-specs repo.
- [Update 5]: Implemented precompiled contracts as specified in the frontier version of the yellow paper in the execution-specs repo.
- [Update 6]: Got all Frontier state tests to pass and fixed all the bugs encountered while doing so.
