## My CDAP Research 

During the course of the apprenticeship program my main focus and 
objective was to understand the development and evolution of Ethereum Protocol and its clients.
As the CDAP come to an end, I consider myself a Cohort-zero Apprentice for life as 
I will be learning more as Ethereum Protocol Expand its evolution. [`./notes/Nhlanhla.md`](./../notes/Nhlanhla.md)
