## About Me

I'm a software engineer interested in distributed systems and economics.

## My CDAP Project

I contributed to the portal network at both the specification level and the implementation level.
I was the primary author of the [chain history spec](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/master/history-network.md), and I contributed to the [trin](https://github.com/ethereum/trin) implementation.

For the chain history spec, I was able to leverage the pre-existing work on the [state spec](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/master/state-network.md) and the [Alexandria network](https://notes.ethereum.org/oUJE4ZX2Q6eMOgEMiQPkpQ?view).
As part of this work, I researched existing distributed storage networks (e.g. BitTorrent) and the academic literature on distributed hash tables, primarily Kademlia.
Additionally, I researched the [Discovery v5 protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md), which the portal network is built on top of.

The trin implementation of the portal network is written in Rust, which was a new programming language for me.
My initial contributions were relatively simple, but with a higher proficiency in Rust and a deeper understanding of the portal network and Discovery v5, I was able to make more meaningful [contributions](https://github.com/ethereum/trin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajacobkaufmann+) to the codebase.
